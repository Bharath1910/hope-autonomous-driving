## How is it working ?

In this video, the program processes the image of the screen, gives it to the artificial intelligence model, turns the steering wheel according to the result.

The model gives us a pixel value equal to the steering angle of the steering wheel. Then the mouse is moved to this pixel value.

I drove the vehicle for 1 hour and also collected data and saved them in a CSV file.
